    	<img src="romeo.jpg"width="100%" height="100%">
    	<p>The first time Romeo saw her, the world stopped. There, bathed in torchlight
    	 at a masquerade she was never meant to attend, Juliet laughed—a sound so bright it 
    	 cut through the bitter feud between their families like a blade through silk. Their eyes met,
    	  and in that heartbeat, something dangerous was born..

    	<p>
    		In a world where music could move mountains, Orpheus played with a soul so pure that even the gods paused to listen. When his beloved Eurydice was taken too soon, his love refused to let go. With nothing but his lyre and a heart full of hope, he journeyed into the underworld—not to mourn, but to bring her back. One rule. One glance. One moment that could change everything.

    	<p>
    		Alina was the kind of girl who followed every rule—polished, quiet, and wrapped in the expectations of a world that demanded perfection. In her college class, she kept to herself, eyes on her books, heart locked away. But then there was Kian—warm, effortless, and impossible to ignore. He wasn’t just a boy with a smile; he was a question she didn’t want to answer. And yet, the more she tried to silence her feelings, the louder they echoed… until one day, her heart spoke first.
